     * Force a segment into a constrained Delaunay triangulation by deleting the
     * triangles it intersects, and triangulating the polygons that form on each
     * side of it.
     * <br><br>
     * Generates a single subsegment connecting 'endpoint1' to 'endpoint2'.
     * The triangle 'starttri' has 'endpoint1' as its origin.  'newmark' is the
     * boundary marker of the segment.
     * <br><br>
     * To insert a segment, every triangle whose interior intersects the
     * segment is deleted. The union of these deleted triangles is a polygon
     * (which is not necessarily monotone, but is close enough), which is
     * divided into two polygons by the new segment. This routine's task is
     * to generate the Delaunay triangulation of these two polygons.
     * <br><br>
     * You might think of this routine's behavior as a two-step process.  The
     * first step is to walk from endpoint1 to endpoint2, flipping each edge
     * encountered.  This step creates a fan of edges connected to endpoint1,
     * including the desired edge to endpoint2. The second step enforces the
     * Delaunay condition on each side of the segment in an incremental manner:
     * proceeding along the polygon from endpoint1 to endpoint2 (this is done
     * independently on each side of the segment), each vertex is "enforced"
     * as if it had just been inserted, but affecting only the previous
     * vertices. The result is the same as if the vertices had been inserted
     * in the order they appear on the polygon, so the result is Delaunay.
     * <br><br>
     * In truth, ConstrainedEdge() interleaves these two steps. The procedure
     * walks from endpoint1 to endpoint2, and each time an edge is encountered
     * and flipped, the newly exposed vertex (at the far end of the flipped
     * edge) is "enforced" upon the previously flipped edges, usually affecting
     * only one side of the polygon (depending upon which side of the segment
     * the vertex falls on).
     * <br><br>
     * The algorithm is complicated by the need to handle polygons that are not
     * convex.  Although the polygon is not necessarily monotone, it can be
     * triangulated in a manner similar to the stack-based algorithms for
     * monotone polygons. For each reflex vertex (local concavity) of the
     * polygon, there will be an inverted triangle formed by one of the edge
     * flips. (An inverted triangle is one with negative area - that is, its
     * vertices are arranged in clockwise order - and is best thought of as a
     * wrinkle in the fabric of the mesh.)  Each inverted triangle can be
     * thought of as a reflex vertex pushed on the stack, waiting to be fixed
     * later.
     * <br><br>
     * A reflex vertex is popped from the stack when a vertex is inserted that
     * is visible to the reflex vertex. (However, if the vertex behind the
     * reflex vertex is not visible to the reflex vertex, a new inverted
     * triangle will take its place on the stack.) These details are handled
     * by the DelaunayFixup() routine above.
